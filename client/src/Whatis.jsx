Blockchain is a data structure that links things together that are protected and connected by cryptography. Throughout the world it has gained tons of attention for its disruptive technology that has expanded from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 stage application. The innovation of this technology only allows information that can only be accessible to the direct user creating a data privacy environment. 

To understand what the blockchain is you must first understand what a database is. A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on computer systems. A database consists of a structured table that makes it easier to search and filter specific information. These are used to hold large amount of data and are usually built on super powerful computers sometimes consisting of 100 to 1000 computers. So now that we know what a database is the one key difference between a database and blockchain is the way the data is structured. A blockchain collects information in groups known as blocks. They have certain storage capacities and when filled they are chained onto previously filled blocks which forms the word, blockchain. The key difference is a database uses tables while a blockchain uses chunks of data that are chained together. So, each block within the chain when filled is set in stone and given a timestamp to when it is added to the chain. So, with having to store data is blockchain secure? Yes, for blockchain security the new blocks are always stored linearly and chronologically. Once a block has been added to the blockchain it is very difficult to go back and alter its contents and this is because each block has its own hash making it very secure. Also, each block is timestamped as recently stated and if you were to mess with the block of data it would change the timestamp which in turn would change the hash. So how is blockchain used? Blockchain is a reliable way to store data which is why we have built a database for business/schools to use as a database!
